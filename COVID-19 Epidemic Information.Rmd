# Set up
## R Libraries
R is extended using packages or libraries. For this analysis the following
packages are used. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

Note: the tidyverse package loads a set of packages that make up the tidy data
universe. Use of the tidyverse package to load these packages is a convince instead
of loading each individual backage.

## Get data
Two R scripts are used to read in the data used. The source of this data is
the WHO, for world wide data,  and the CDC for US data. While the WHO data 
contains data for the US the CDC data is being used. The WHO data is a series of
files scraped from their daily situtation reports and the CDC data is scraped from 
their web site for the CORANA virus. Due tothe WHO data being in 85 plus files
the execution of these scripts is not shown to insure that the files is not overly
large.
```{r get data, include=FALSE}
source("./scripts/WHO.R")
source("./scripts/CDC.R")
```

## Create data set for Germany

The data for Germany is extracted from the WHO data for easy in displaying
```{r}
germany <- WHO %>%
     filter(`Country Territory area` == "Germany")
```

## Create data set for world wide data

This data set displays the daily total for world wide data.
```{r}
world <- WHO %>%
     group_by(`date`) %>%
     summarise(`Number of new cases` = sum(`Confirmed new cases`),
               cum = sum(`total Confirmed Cases`))
world$`Week Number` <- week(world$date)
```

### Complete data set
CDC designates a date to which they consider the data "good". Reported data after
that date is considered incomplete due to delays in reporting. This intial set of plots
uses the complete data set
